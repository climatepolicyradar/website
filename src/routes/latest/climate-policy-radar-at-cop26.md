**Going with the flow: from ancient water systems to AI-enhanced policymaking**

This interactive session will explore what is needed to ensure evidence-based decision making to support abundant and healthy living systems - what we can learn from ancient practices of sharing resources in a community, how we can borrow design principles from nature to create and unblock flows of useful knowledge in a system, and how can we use the power of (and avoid the pitfalls of) artificial intelligence to enhance and accelerate evidence-based decision making.

Speakers:

- Michal Nachmany, Climate Policy Radar
- Bryony Worthington, UK House of Lords
- Nathalie Seddon, Head of the Nature Based Solutions Initiative, University of Oxford
