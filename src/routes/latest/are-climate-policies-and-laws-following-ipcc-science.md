excerpt: Our new data exploration shows that national governments' climate laws
  and policies have been referencing IPCC research for at least 2 decades, and
  reports have increasingly been cited after their publication.

On Monday 20 March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish the Synthesis Report for its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), bringing together its research across climate science, impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and mitigation. 

In recent years, the work of the IPCC to assess collective progress in responding to climate change has gained substantial public and media attention, highlighting the ever-shrinking window of opportunity to deliver on the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

Similarly, while we have found evidence in our data that national governments have been referencing IPCC research in their climate laws and policies for at least two decades, engagement with this key evidence base for policy formulation also appears to have increased since the IPCC was founded in 1988.

In our own work to build tools to support effective, evidence-based policymaking on climate change, we want to shed light on how and why countries decide on measures to adopt in responding to climate change. Ahead of the publication of the Synthesis Report this week, we tracked references to the IPCC in national laws and policies over time. 

## Identifying trends in laws and policies

We explored the Climate Policy Radar database containing over 3,500 climate laws and policies from every national government, focussing on the inclusion of evidence from the IPCC’s reports. We searched for references to IPCC Assessment Reports 1-6 in documents, alongside mentions of the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target, which was the focus of the IPCC’s Special Report on global warming in 2018. We also looked at the implementation of laws and policies from 1980 to 2022. 

## Trends in climate law and policy implementation over time

We found that the number of climate laws and policies published each year has increased substantially over time (see Chart 1), particularly after the early 2000s by which point three IPCC reports had been published (Assessment Reports 1-3). However this dipped after 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Citations of IPCC publications

As shown in Chart 2, IPCC Assessment Reports have increasingly been cited in national laws and policies following their publication. While AR3 (2001) appears to see minimal citation until later years, AR4 (2007) sees significant citation immediately after publication and continuing until the present.

AR5 (2013) appears to have been actively anticipated in national laws and policies, with references identified ahead of its publication (see Chart 3 below). For example, [Singapore’s National Climate Change Strategy](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/singapore_2012_national-climate-change-strategy_1619_1637) (2012) states: "Over time, these findings will be updated as climate science and models improve, and more information such as that arising from the Fifth Assessment Report by the IPCC becomes available." We also identified references to AR6 (2021) beginning in 2015, with the first reference coming from Japan’s “[National Plan for Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change: Cabinet Decision](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/japan_2015_national-plan-for-adaptation-to-the-impacts-of-climate-change-cabinet-decision_8647_1926)”, indicating Japan’s preparedness to contribute resources and expertise to the report.

AR4 (2007) appears to be the most widely cited IPCC report, with more than 100 citations across publications from almost 70 national governments.

## References to 1.5°C global warming target

There has been an overall upward trend in references to the 1.5°C target in laws and policies, most notably in 2021 when the postponed COP26 climate summit was held (see Chart 5). We also observe a significant increase in references to 1.5°C in 2016, the year after the 1.5°C target was established in the Paris Agreement, and an uptick in the number of mentions following the release of the [IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) in 2018.

## Science-based law and policy

The IPCC is the world’s leading authority on the science of climate change. We identified a number of examples of the way governments articulate their approach to integrating the best available science into the development of climate law and policy. 

References to the ‘best available science’ are frequently linked to the IPCC. Fiji’s [2021 Climate Change Act](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/fiji_2021_climate-change-act-2021_10190_4775) is framed as “a response to the current and future risks of climate change, informed by the best available science published by the IPCC to date”. Similarly, the UK’s [2021 Net Zero Strategy](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/united-kingdom_2021_net-zero-strategy-build-back-greener_10238_5025) contains a pledge to “promote the vital role of the IPCC and other scientific research… enabling informed decision-making across the world”. 

Crucially, a number of national laws and policies recognise the closely linked roles of IPCC research and indigenous knowledge systems in responding to climate change, particularly in the context of adaptation. For instance, Zimbabwe’s [2017 National Climate Policy](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/zimbabwe_2018_national-climate-policy_8677_1481) sets out a plan to “Strengthen the documentation of indigenous knowledge systems to complement scientific knowledge for climate change forecasting and early warning systems”. 

With the AR6 cycle now drawing to a close, and no further IPCC reports anticipated for at least four years, it’s vital that laws and policies continue to embed the best available evidence into their design and delivery, so that they have the best chances of success. Through our work to open up data on climate laws and policies across the world, our goal is to help provide that robust evidence base and enable decision-makers to design ambitious but effective climate strategies.
