excerpt: When I joined Climate Policy Radar back at the start of December last
  year, I knew pretty much nothing about tech products, natural language
  processing, data science, product management, or the tech world in general.
  With a PhD on international climate negotiations at the UNFCCC, and some time
  in DG CLIMA of the European Commission, my background is mostly in academia,
  with a little in the public sector.

When I joined Climate Policy Radar back at the start of December last year, I knew pretty much nothing about tech products, natural language processing, data science, product management, or the tech world in general. With a PhD on international climate negotiations at the UNFCCC, and some time in DG CLIMA of the European Commission, my background is mostly in academia, with a little in the public sector.

So, you can imagine how bizarre and confusing the following sentence sounded to me when said by our data scientist Kalyan in a stand-up meeting during my first week:

“OK, cool – so I’ll move the extraction epic in Github from the icebox to the sprint backlog – and you can view it in Zenhub as well, by the way”.

…what?

Was I to infer from this, that some kind of… historical screenplay about a covert ops rescue mission (?) will be moved, within a meeting place for irritating and irritable people (?), from either a drinks cooler or a place of punishment (?), to…a place to warm up before an athletics meet? And that you could watch all this happening from a meeting place for meditative Buddhists?!?

And why are we discussing all of this in what it’s implied will be a comedy gig at 9:30am?

I was a little daunted coming into CPR because of exactly this kind of confusion – the worry I would be out of my depth and not have any idea of what was going on.  I thought (and think!) the idea behind our mission is a fantastic one, and that what we go on to produce – a tool enabling easy access and interrogation of climate law and policy data – will be priceless. I was just concerned that, with no prior tech experience, I wouldn’t be able to make much of a contribution towards it.

*Yeah…your guess is as good as mine was, to be honest…*
