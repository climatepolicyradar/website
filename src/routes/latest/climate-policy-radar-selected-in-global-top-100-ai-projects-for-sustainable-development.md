We’re delighted to announce that Climate Policy Radar has been named among the world’s most promising projects harnessing artificial intelligence to advance the United Nations' sustainable development goals. 

[The Global Top 100](https://ircai.org/global-top-100-outstanding-projects/results/) is an initiative of The International Research Centre in Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI), a UNESCO AI Centre established to mobilise the world’s AI community for the benefit of humanity.

Our work to open up climate law and policy data to support evidence-based decision-making was rated ‘Excellent’ by the List, which aims to scope and showcase solutions from around the world and contribute to the SDGs by creating the world’s largest sustainable solutions platform.

Our research tools offer open access to the world’s climate laws and policies, helping people discover, understand and generate data-driven insights that can inform climate action. 

Beyond climate change, this effort cuts across almost all of the SDGs. Laws and policies in question are relevant to many other global goals including (clean) energy access, innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities, responsible production and consumption, and gender equality (underpinning climate resilience).

While our current focus is the climate, our goal is to extend and apply our framework to tackle other areas vital for sustainable development such as biodiversity, health and finance. We’re already charting our steps towards this goal - you can find out what we’re developing, planning and dreaming about in our [public roadmap](https://climatepolicyradar.org/latest/climate-policy-radar-launches-public-product-roadmap).
