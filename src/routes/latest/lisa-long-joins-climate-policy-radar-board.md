We are delighted that Lisa Long - a serial entrepreneur, non-executive director, and private equity advisor - has joined Climate Policy Radar's board as a non-executive director.

Lisa says: "*I am very excited to be joining the team at Climate Policy Radar, and contributing to their work in rising to the challenge of better climate policymaking. To be working at global level in this way, with scalable impact and open source access, is a privilege and pleasure. I am looking forward to this journey and to those beyond, where insight-enabling data fundamentally changes the landscape of our collective decision-making*."

In her own company Before You Code, she provides executive coaching and product management advisory for start-up and growth companies. She currently serves on the board of Vilmer in Norway, the product advisory council for Ushahidi, and is an advisor to private equity firm Spring Capital. 

Through both her start-up experience and her work at Skype/Microsoft and Telenor, she is recognized as a product management and scaling expert and has spoken at conferences from Lviv to San Francisco. She is a guest lecturer on entrepreneurship at INSEAD. Lisa has an MBA from INSEAD and a BS in chemical engineering from Cornell University.
