We are thrilled to welcome Steven Ramage to Climate Policy Radar’s Board as a non-executive director. Steven brings a powerful blend of skills and experience at the intersection of climate, nature, and technology, which will be pivotal in our next phase of development and growth.

Throughout his three-decade long career, Steven has harnessed cutting edge technology for better environmental and socioeconomic decision making. His experience spans the UN, academia, the private sector, and government. As the Founder and CEO of Réseau Consulting, he advances policy, decision making, and action through strategic insights and evidence, international community collaboration and cooperation.

Steven's commitment to protecting and future-proofing our planet is evident through his advisory roles with international organisations, including GIZ, NASA, UNEP, UNFCCC, and the World Bank. In his role as Senior Business Advisor at the United Nations, he collaborates with the Science-Policy-Business Forum (UN-SBPF) on crucial issues such as the big data strategy for the environment.

His enthusiasm, energy and deep expertise will significantly enhance our efforts to accelerate climate action. His vision aligns perfectly with our mission to leverage AI and open data to tackle the world’s most pressing climate challenges.

Steven said: *‘Many organisations are talking about open data and AI, Climate Policy Radar is actually doing it. They are addressing the big policy questions that are a crucial lever to accelerate climate action. I’m grateful they have agreed to bring me on board and I look forward to working with this forward-thinking team.’*
