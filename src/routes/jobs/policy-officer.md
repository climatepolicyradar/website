## About us

Climate Policy Radar is a start-up on a mission to organise, analyse, and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build open databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven insights on public laws and policies. Our work helps governments, researchers, international organisations, civil society, and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies and deploy climate finance.

Harnessing data science and AI, and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data. This serves to enhance accountability, and promote data democratisation, transforming our search engine into a virtual research assistant for the climate world, powered by a unique open knowledge graph. We are deeply embedded in the global climate and AI communities, and count some of the most important organisations and global climate leaders amongst our users, advocates, friends and advisors.

We’re a Community Interest Company (CIC), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice — including open code and open data. [Our team](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#team) is characterised by its high level of expertise, shared mission-driven ethos, and a strong collaborative spirit that welcomes individuals from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.

The Policy Team is central to Climate Policy Radar's mission of making climate law and policy globally accessible and actionable. It acts as a knowledge hub for the organisation, constantly seeking new methodologies and approaches to analysing and interpreting policy documents, and works with external stakeholders to share knowledge and deliver bespoke projects. The team is a critical conduit between the world of climate policy and the technological capabilities of Climate Policy Radar, ensuring the product remains relevant, accurate, and valuable to its users.

## Roles and responsibilities

We’re looking for a Policy Officer with a solid background in climate policy or research work, with brilliant research and analytical skills. You will work within the policy and research teams, and in close collaboration with the data science and other teams:

* Document Analysis: Using your domain knowledge, you will conduct research to identify crucial climate law and policy documents to add to our growing database. This involves understanding global trends and priorities in climate policy.
* Concept Analysis: Collaborate with Data Scientists to develop our understanding of critical climate law and policy-related concepts that will feed into natural language processing and machine learning models for analysis of global climate-related legal and policy texts (no prior knowledge of data science or machine learning models is needed, though a keen interest and desire to learn is necessary!).
* Interface Design Input: Provide insights to the Product Team on how decision-makers interact with climate data, influencing user interface design.
* Stakeholder Engagement: Develop and maintain a network of partners and collaborators (ranging from academia and research institutions to intergovernmental organisations and civil society), to: 
* * Make sure we are synced with latest thinking and developments in the field
  * Develop and deliver joint high-impact bespoke projects and programmes 
  * Help bring our work to them and their stakeholders. 
* Trend Analysis: Keep abreast of emerging trends in climate policy, ensuring the product remains relevant and ahead of market needs.
* Communication and documentation: Prepare clear, non-technical reports on policy findings and product development recommendations, and further our outreach by independently producing and/or contributing to written output like blog posts, articles.

## You bring with you:

* At least 3 years experience in policy analysis, preferably in climate change or environmental sectors, from within government, research organisations or think tanks, NGOs or similar.
* Rigorous, detail-oriented, methodical research and analytical skills with the ability to interpret complex legal documents
* Creativity in your approach to problem solving
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change-related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, international negotiations and the UNFCCC process). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well-informed ‘Climatese’ speaker. 
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Effective communication skills, capable of liaising between technical and non-technical teams, and communicating knowledge to different audiences.
* Proficient in data interpretation and presentation.
* Excitement about the environment that a startup presents.
* Values that are aligned with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). 

## We offer

* Salary £30-40k pa, depending on experience.
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing: our policies include unlimited leave, flexible work hours, an annual well-being allowance and short Fridays. 
* Hybrid work setup: we meet as a team once or twice weekly. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s old County Hall building.
