## A﻿bout us

Climate Policy Radar is a startup on a mission to organise, analyse and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven law and policy insights. Harnessing data science and AI and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data, and helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We’re a Community interest Company championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice.

## The Role

We’re looking for research assistants with an undergraduate or masters degree in a climate, law or policy related field, with brilliant research and analytical skills. You will work within the policy and research teams, and in close collaboration with the data science and other teams. You will also work closely with our partners at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. You will perform the following tasks:

* Data cleaning (eg. entering missing data, finding new links where links are broken)
* Updating our world-leading law and policy database - identifying new (and changed) on government websites, academic and policy literature, and other databases.
* Labelling data to train machine learning models to identify specific climate law and policy concepts (you do not need any prior machine learning knowledge)
* Attend monthly meetings with CPR and LSE colleagues relating to the database and data updates

## You bring with you

* An undergraduate or masters degree in a climate, law or policy related field
* Rigorous, detail-oriented, methodical research and analytical skills
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change-related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, international negotiations and the UNFCCC process). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well-informed ‘Climatese’ speaker. 
* Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to communicate and translate knowledge to different audiences.
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Excitement about the environment that a startup presents.
* Values that are aligned with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). 
* Highly desirable: Proficiency in a language or languages other than English, particularly French, Spanish, or Portuguese, is highly desirable. 

## We offer

* £20/hour for up minimum of 10-hours a week
* Hybrid work setup: we meet as a team once or twice weekly. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s old County Hall building, however, we are open to a remote set up.

## Interview process

We know that applying for a new job can be full of uncertainties - and we aim to reduce those by communicating clearly. 

Our process requires the submission of your CV and cover letter and a 30-minute interview with two members of the team. After this, we aim to get back to you within a week. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation during the process of application and selection, please let us know
