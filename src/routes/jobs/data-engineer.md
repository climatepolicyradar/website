## Who we are

Climate Policy Radar CIC (CPR) is a climate AI start-up on a mission to map and analyse the global policy landscape using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to pool the world's fragmented climate policy data, making it easier to search and examine the measures that have been implemented to tackle climate change, so that we can identify what works and what doesn’t. Our work helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We're a not-for-profit startup (registered Community Interest Company), having secured substantial grant funding in our first round, and about to fundraise for the next round. With a team of 9 and about to be 13, we have just launched our first (Alpha) product, working towards general access by November. CPR is at an extremely exciting stage. We are now looking for a brilliant and committed Data Engineer to join our team.

## Role Overview

Currently the data science team are working on data engineering tasks;processing unstructured data, and building data pipelines and data models - all this while doing ML reesarch. We we are now looking to hire a Senior Data Engineer to take ownership of these tasks, working closely with our data science, engineering and policy teams, build the data pipelines that will enable ML research, and help shape our longer-term data engineering roadmap. 

It’s an exciting time to join as the Beta product is becoming much more complex in terms of data. Currently we focus on processing one unstructured data type (PDF documents) into structured data using machine learning. Over the next months we will be adding additional complexity: 

* Processing new data types e.g. HTML  
* Incorporating multilingual data sets  
* Implementing intelligent web scraping  
* Increase the number of documents processed from an order of thousands to an order of hundreds of thousands  

## The impact you’ll have in the next 6-12 months: 

* Understanding the needs of the product and teams to build out a plan/roadmap for data engineering  
* Provide pragmatic advice on the best tech and tools to meet our needs  
* Review and improve the current data infrastructure setup  
* Build and operate robust, maintainable and automated data pipelines to power ML modelling,  acquiring data from a variety of textual sources ranging from websites to APIs to curated data sets.   

## Requirements

* Experienced using Python   
* Experience of building scalable data pipelines for ingestion and processing of large unstructured data sources, incorporating machine learning models  
* Broad knowledge and experience of selecting tools that can be used to build a toolchain. Being pragmatic in deciding between off-the-shelf versus building bespoke solutions
* Experience using cloud infrastructure (AWS)  
* Extensive knowledge of different data store types, including SQL and NoSQL, OLAP and OLTP, and open source and proprietary data warehouses in general 
* Solid understanding of software engineering fundamentals, version control (Git), shell scripting, OOP, unit and integration testing
* Experience in system architecture and making technical decisions 
* Appreciation for what it means to work in an early-stage startup, balancing trade-offers, rolling your sleeves up, limited resources, helping each other out
* Excellent communication skills. You feel comfortable working with technical and non-technical stakeholders, understanding their needs and discussing solutions in a positive and insightful way
* Happy to work in an agile development process

## We offer…

* Salary between £75k-£85k, depending on experience 
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing. Our policies include unlimited leave, flexible work hours, a wellbeing allowance and short Fridays.
* Hybrid work setup: we usually meet up as a team once/twice a week. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s County Hall Building. 
* A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey ‒ we are a young startup building our team and vision, so your input and impact will be significant.
