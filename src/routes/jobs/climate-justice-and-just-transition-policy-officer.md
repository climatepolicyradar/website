## Who we are

Climate Policy Radar is a startup on a mission to organise, analyse and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven law and policy insights. Harnessing data science and AI and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data, and helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We’re a Community Interest Company (not-for-profit), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice. With a team of 17 and growing, we are now looking for a brilliant and committed Climate Justice Researcher/Policy officer to join our team and help ensure we are not only at the forefront of understanding and analysing the rapidly evolving climate law and policy landscape - but that we do so with a clear focus on principles and practices of environmental and climate justice and just transition, in order to:

* Contribute to reducing inequalities and injustice related to and exacerbated by climate change  
* Contribute to reducing adverse impacts on communities arising from the climate and energy transitions
* Increase visibility and representation of environmental justice and just transition related issues of impacted communities 

## R﻿ole and responsibilities

We’re looking for a Climate Justice and Just  Transition Policy Officer with a solid background in climate justice policy/research work either within civil society organisations or research organisations/think tanks, with brilliant research and analytical skills. You will work within the policy and research teams, and in close collaboration with the data science and other teams:

* Using your domain knowledge, you’ll contribute to research to develop climate justice and just transition related taxonomies, that will feed into natural language processing and machine learning models for analysis of global climate-related legal and policy texts (no prior knowledge of data science or machine learning models is needed, though a keen interest and desire to learn is necessary!)
* Track emerging trends and proposals on climate justice and equity and provide analysis and advice to influence the product features that we introduce 
* Develop and maintain a network of partners and collaborators (academia and research institutions, IGOs, impacted communities, civil society and more), to:

  * Make sure we are synced with the latest thinking and developments in the field, including representation of impacted communities
  * Develop and deliver joint high-impact bespoke projects and programme
  * Help bring our work to them and their stakeholders
* Further our outreach by independently producing and/or contributing to written output like blog posts, articles, infographics
* Be a source of knowledge in your field of expertise contributing to the wider team

## Y﻿ou bring with you

* At least 5 years experience in climate justice policy/research work, either within civil society organisations or research organisations/academia/think tanks
* Rigorous, detail-oriented, methodical research and analytical skills
* Creativity in your approach to problem solving
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change-related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, international negotiations and the UNFCCC process). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well-informed ‘Climatese’ speaker. 
* Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to communicate and translate knowledge to different audiences.
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Excitement about the environment that a startup presents.[](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values) 
* V﻿alues that align with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values).

## We offer

* Salary £40-£50k pa, depending on experience.
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing: our policies include unlimited leave, hybrid and flexible work hours, and wellbeing allowance. We are currently trialling a 4-day work week (same pay, all Fridays off) with an intention and hope to make this a permanent arrangement.
* Hybrid work setup: we meet as a team once or twice weekly. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s old County Hall building.
