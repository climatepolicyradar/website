We are a not-for-profit climate startup on a mission to map the global policy landscape, using AI to create the evidence base for informed decision-making. Our work helps governments, private sector, researchers and civil society advance effective climate change policies.

 

We are looking for a brilliant, committed individual to make sure the organisation runs smoothly and that our team has the best conditions to be happy and productive.

* Help us grow and develop Climate Policy Radar in many other ways 

 

What you will bring:

* Strong organisational and administrative skills.
* Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.
* Ability to work independently - and excellent team skills. 
* High proficiency in productivity tools (such as Microsoft Office, G-Suite) and web-based operations software (such as accounting, hiring or CRM systems).

 

We offer:

* A high impact and exciting mission at the intersection of technology, AI and policy. A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey ‒ we are a young startup building our team and vision, so your input and impact will be significant.
* Access to a larger community of climate and data enthusiasts ‒ we are a member of Subak, an accelerator and cooperative for climate non-profit startups, and enjoy a joint programme of learning, collaborating and socialising.
* A deep commitment to our employees’ mental and physical wellbeing. Among others we offer unlimited leave, flexible work hours, a generous wellbeing allowance, short Fridays, and great coffee.
* Hybrid work arrangement: stunning work space overlooking Westminster Bridge, combined with remote working.
