With a team of ten and expanding, and about to launch our first product, Climate Policy Radar is at an extremely exciting stage. We are now looking for a brilliant and committed Mid-Senior Python Engineer to join our team.

As a company, we are deeply committed to our employees’ overall wellbeing, reflected in our progressive policies, including offering unlimited leave, flexible working and a wellbeing allowance. 



## Role Overview

* You’ll report to our CTO and work closely alongside our experienced Senior Software Engineer (see [our team page](https://climatepolicyradar.org/team) to get to know everyone)
* You’ll collaborate on the design and build of our evolving backend of the web app, including ETL, API, security, database 
* You’ll help to define the system architecture
* This will be a varied role where you’ll get to work on cloud infrastructure, web crawling, data processing, storage, and REST APIs. 

## Requirements

* Experienced using Python with one of the modern frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Tornado etc) to build REST APIs
* Experienced in system architecture. Comfortable building a greenfield product and making critical technical decisions. 
* Experienced in AWS and functions like EC2, S3, auto-scaling and security. Able to select and set up the right configuration for what we need alongside DevOps tooling (Docker, ECS)
* Strong database knowledge, SQL and PostgreSQL
* Solid understanding of software engineering fundamentals, version control (Git), shell scripting, OOP, unit and integration testing.
* Appreciation for what it means to work in an early-stage startup, balancing trade-offers, rolling your sleeves up and limited resources. 

## Bonus if you have…

* Worked on an AI-driven product. Used to working closely with data scientists or machine learning engineers, understanding some of the concepts and terminology.
* Data engineering skills. Any experience in building scalable data pipelines for ingestion and processing of large unstructured data sources, incorporating machine learning models and using tools like Airflow or Dagster. 
* Experience in building web scraping scripts and knowledge of JavaScript would be advantageous but is not essential.

## We offer…

* Salary £60k-£75k depending on experience
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing. Our policies include:

  * Unlimited leave 
  * Flexible work hours, we care about output rather than clock watching. Find a work schedule that fits in with your personal life. 
  * £500 wellbeing allowance
  * Short Fridays
  * Great coffee (on the house)
  * Hybrid work setup, we try to meet up as a team once a week/fortnight for planning and refinement sessions. We have a stunning workspace in Westminster Bridge for when we do get together and most of the team choose to work in the office 1-2 days a week
* Equipment – choice of Mac or Windows laptop and anything else to get you set up at home
* A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey ‒ we are a young startup building our team and vision, so your input and impact will be significant.
* Access to a larger community - we are a member of Subak, an accelerator and cooperative for climate non-profit startups, and enjoy a joint programme of learning, collaborating and socialising. Our shared offices are at Sustainable Workspaces, hosting other sustainability companies and a  programme of training and events.
