## Who we are

Climate Policy Radar is on a mission to organise, analyse and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build open databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven insights on public laws and policies and corporate policies. Harnessing data science and AI and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data, and helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. We are embarking on an ambitious roadmap, transforming our [search engine](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org) into a research assistant for the climate world, powered by a unique open knowledge graph and significantly scaling our datasets, capabilities, team, and impact. If you are passionate about having an impact on the global climate response, Climate Policy Radar is the perfect opportunity for you. We are deeply embedded in the global climate and AI communities, and count some of the most important organisations and global climate leaders amongst our users, advocates, friends and advisors.

We’re a Community Interest Company (not-for-profit), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice — including open code and data. Our team is currently 17 and we are embarking on a significant growth phase, expanding to around 30.

We are seeking a Head of Engineering who will be instrumental in our journey, supporting high-scale, high-impact engineering teams building tools to help move the needle on climate change.

## Role Overview

In this role, you will lead and scale multiple teams of software and data engineers in developing high-impact tools and products for global climate law and policy, already serving 300,000 users annually and opening up 400,000 pages of climate documentation.

As the Head of Engineering, you will play a pivotal role in shaping the engineering function and fostering a diverse and inclusive environment. Our team is highly expert, mission-driven, and collaborative, we see code as a conversation, and we welcome different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.

## Responsibilities

* Manage, develop, and mentor our team of engineers at all levels, building further our high-trust, psychologically safe and collaborative culture
* Strategically scale diverse engineering teams sustainably (aiming to double the size within a year), including hiring and onboarding new team members, and aligning with our core values of trust and psychological safety
* Drive the team towards the successful delivery of user value across our product portfolio using agile techniques and prizing flexibility
* Work with the CEO, CTO, Tech Lead, and Head of Product on the technical vision, roadmap, and design of our product portfolio, and provide technical leadership for the engineering teams to deliver high-impact products and services
* Facilitate seamless collaboration between engineering, leadership, and other functional units
* Champion engineering excellence in all its forms, driving continuous improvement for team health, processes, operations, governance, and quality, security, and performance of our products

## Who you are

We are looking for candidates with experience leading engineering teams through early-stage scale-up with trust, empathy, and mentorship. Ideal candidates will bring a broad knowledge and hands-on experience in high-quality, best-practice cloud-native applications.

* Demonstrable experience in engineering leadership, developing and scaling high-performance and diverse engineering teams (especially through periods of significant growth), and building software products from concept to launch
* Have worked in start-up/scale-up environments with fast pace and shifting or uncertain requirements
* Best in class knowledge of software engineering best practices, agile development, how to implement and maintain high quality and high-velocity processes, and how to ensure quality and robustness in software products
* A good understanding of distributed web systems, high-scale data architectures, and ML-focused products, with hands-on experience in Python and AWS
* Data-driven, biasing towards empiricism, lean practices, and validation of assumptions
* A servant leader with superior communication skills and high empathy, who can foster an environment where diverse and high-trust teams can thrive and flourish with independence
* Familiarity with the practice of data science, machine learning, and especially NLP, is nice to have
* Strong alignment with our [values](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values)
* Motivated and enthusiastic about creating a driven and high-achieving software team

## Our technology stack

* Python for our containerised backend services and data science, using FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy; Next.js/React for our frontends
* AWS, including Postgres on RDS, AppRunner, Batch, Step functions, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, S3, and Opensearch
* Pulumi to manage infrastructure as code
* Grafana cloud stack for observability
* Vespa for search backend

Experience with all of these is not a pre-requisite, but there should be a good level of alignment on core aspects of our stack.

Across our roadmap, we are building out an extensive MLOps platform including tools supporting rapid generation of high-quality labelled datasets, classifier training, generative AI functionality and productionisation (relying on open-source models), a set of data pipelines for ingesting large numbers of new documents and applying machine learning techniques to them, and a knowledge graph datastore derived from our extensive document dataset. We are developing our product to support and extend our position as a data aggregator working with data provider partners, with a wide variety of innovative ways to access and analyse structured law and policy data, and extensive bespoke ecosystem partner functionality.

## What we offer

* Salary ranging from £110k to £125k depending on experience
* A strong commitment to employee wellbeing, including policies such as 4 day workweek, generous leave, and a wellbeing allowance
* A vibrant, collaborative, and empathetic work culture that thrives on innovation and the impact of our work
* A hybrid work environment in our fantastic workspace, offering views of the river in London’s County Hall Building. We have a two-day office presence each week
