## Who we are

[Climate Policy Radar](http://climatepolicyradar.org/) is a startup on a mission to organise, analyse, and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build open databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven insights on public laws and policies. Our work helps governments, researchers, international organisations, civil society, and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies and deploy climate finance.

Harnessing data science and AI, and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data. This serves to enhance accountability, and promote data democratisation, transforming our [search engine](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org) into a virtual research assistant for the climate world, powered by a unique open knowledge graph. We are deeply embedded in the global climate and AI communities, and count some of the most important organisations and global climate leaders amongst our users, advocates, friends and advisors.

We’re a Community Interest Company (CIC), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice — including open code and data. [Our team](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#team) is characterised by its high level of expertise, shared mission-driven ethos, and a strong collaborative spirit that welcomes individuals from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.

We are seeking a Python contractor to work with us and support high-scale, high-impact engineering teams building tools to help move the needle on climate change.

## Role Overview

We are looking for a full-stack engineer to help us develop some of our internal tooling. The tool (our ‘admin service’) is a custom built content management system which enables internal users to create, update and delete entries in our law and policy database, and forms a fundamental part of our product stack. The work will include extending our current offering to include capabilities such as:

* User management: multiple users / multiple organisations; different levels of permissions to users of different roles (e.g. admin, publisher, editor)
* Content management: bulk data upload tooling; improvements to current service 
* Audit logging
* API development

The work will be managed via statements of work.  This contract is outside IR35.

## Who you are

You will be a senior developer, happy working independently and occasionally pairing/collaborating with other members of our team. We are looking for someone who holds themselves to the highest standards of quality and is comfortable delivering well-tested code across the stack at high velocity. 

Key languages/libraries/technologies we use include:

* Python
* SQLAlchemy
* FastAPI
* PyTest for testing
* Pydantic
* React
* TypeScript/JavaScript (at least one of)
* Docker

## What we offer

* A vibrant, collaborative, and empathetic work culture that thrives on innovation and the impact of our work
* You’d be welcome to our fantastic workspace in London’s County Hall Building, or work remotely.
* Learn more about our values [here](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). We care about them deeply.
