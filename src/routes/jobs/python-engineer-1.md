Climate Policy Radar CIC (CPR) is a climate AI startup on a mission to map and analyse the global policy landscape using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Our work helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We’re a not-for-profit startup, having secured our series-A, about to fundraise for the next round. With a team of ten and expanding, and about to launch our first product, CPR is at an extremely exciting stage. We are now looking for a brilliant and committed Mid-Senior Python Engineer to join our team.

As a company, we are deeply committed to our employees’ overall wellbeing, reflected in our progressive policies, including offering unlimited leave, flexible working and a wellbeing allowance.

## Role Overview

* You’ll report to our CEO and work closely alongside our experienced Senior Software Engineer (see [our team page](https://climatepolicyradar.org/team) to get to know everyone)
* You’ll collaborate on the design and build of our evolving backend of the web app, including ETL, API, security, database 
* You’ll help to define the system architecture
* This will be a varied role where you’ll get to work on cloud infrastructure, web crawling, data processing, storage, and REST APIs. 

## Requirements

* Experienced using Python with one of the modern frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Tornado etc) to build REST APIs
* Experienced in system architecture. Comfortable building a greenfield product and making critical technical decisions. 
* Experienced in AWS and functions like EC2, S3, auto-scaling and security. Able to select and set up the right configuration for what we need alongside DevOps tooling (Docker, ECS)
* Strong database knowledge, SQL and PostgreSQL
* Solid understanding of software engineering fundamentals, version control (Git), shell scripting, OOP, unit and integration testing.
* Appreciation for what it means to work in an early-stage startup, balancing trade-offs, rolling your sleeves up and limited resources. 

## Bonus if you have…

* Worked on an AI-driven product. Used to working closely with data scientists or machine learning engineers, understanding some of the concepts and terminology.
* Data engineering skills. Any experience in building scalable data pipelines for ingestion and processing of large unstructured data sources, incorporating machine learning models and using tools like Airflow or Dagster. 
* Experience in building web scraping scripts and knowledge of JavaScript would be advantageous but is not essential.

## We offer…

* Salary £60k-£75k depending on experience
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing. Our policies include: 

  * Unlimited leave
  * Flexible work hours, we care about output rather than clock watching. Find a work schedule that fits in with your personal life. 
  * £500 wellbeing allowance
  * Short Fridays
  * Great coffee (on the house)
  * Hybrid work setup, we try to meet up as a team once a week/fortnight for planning and refinement sessions. We have a stunning workspace in Westminster Bridge for when we do get together and most of the team choose to work in the office 1-2 days a week
* Equipment – choice of Mac or Windows laptop and anything else to get you set up at home
* A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey ‒ we are a young startup building our team and vision, so your input and impact will be significant.
* Access to a larger community - we are a member of Subak, an accelerator and cooperative for climate non-profit startups, and enjoy a joint programme of learning, collaborating and socialising. Our shared offices are at Sustainable Workspaces, hosting other sustainability companies and a  programme of training and events.
