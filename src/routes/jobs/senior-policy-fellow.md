We  are looking for an exceptional climate policy expert to join the growing team at Climate Policy Radar CIC, a not-for-profit climate startup (with secured funding). We are on a mission to map and analyse the global policy landscape, harnessing machine learning to create the evidence base for informed decision-making. Our work helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to advance effective climate policies rapidly, replicate successful approaches, enhance accountability and promote data democratisation. 

## In this role you will...
- Develop policy priorities for our products and programmes. 
- Work closely with our data science team to embed your deep domain knowledge into the development of machine learning models for collection, aggregation and analysis of laws and policy documents.
- Engage with our various stakeholders and allies (policymakers, researchers, knowledge brokers, investors...) to carry out user research, testing, training and support programmes, to deliver knowledge and tools in the most effective way.
- Work independently and with our partners on research and outreach.   
- Help us shape the future of Climate Policy Radar, progressing towards our moonshot and maximising our impact.

## You will bring...

- In-depth knowledge and at least 5 years experience researching/working on issues of climate legislation and policy, broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of concepts and issues relating to climate law and policy. 
- A PhD or postgraduate degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. climate law, geography and environment etc.). 
- Significant experience creating and/or analysing large qualitative datasets.
- Critical thinking and a willingness to challenge assumptions ‒ your own and others’. 
- Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills and the ability to ‘translate’ knowledge for different audiences.
- Excellent organisational skills, and exceptional project planning and management abilities.
- Excitement about the autonomy and changeability that an early stage startup demands. 
- Would be great (but not required) if you can work in one or more of these languages ‒ Spanish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic.

## We offer:
- A high impact and exciting mission at the intersection of technology, AI and policy. 
- A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey ‒ we are a young startup building our team and vision, so your input and impact will be significant.
- Access to a larger community of climate and data enthusiasts ‒ we are a member of Subak, an accelerator and cooperative for climate non-profit startups, and enjoy a joint programme of learning, collaborating and socialising. 
- A deep commitment to our employees’ mental and physical wellbeing. Among others we offer unlimited leave, flexible work hours, a generous wellbeing allowance, short Fridays, and great coffee. 
- We deeply care about our values. See them [here](/about#values).  
- Hybrid work arrangement: stunning work space overlooking Westminster Bridge, combined with remote working.
- Salary range: £42,000-£48,000 based on experience.
