## About us

[Climate Policy Radar](http://climatepolicyradar.org/) is on a mission to organise, analyse, and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build open databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven insights on public laws and policies. Our work helps governments, researchers, international organisations, civil society, and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies and deploy climate finance.

Harnessing data science and AI, and pioneering the application of natural language processing to this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data. This serves to enhance accountability, and promote data democratisation, transforming our [search engine](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org) into a virtual research assistant for the climate world, powered by a unique open knowledge graph. We are deeply embedded in the global climate and AI communities, and count some of the most important organisations and global climate leaders amongst our users, advocates, friends and advisors.

We’re a Community Interest Company (CIC), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice — including open code and data. [Our team](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#team) is currently 20 and we are embarking on a significant growth phase. Our team is characterised by its high level of expertise, shared mission-driven ethos, and a strong collaborative spirit that welcomes individuals from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.

We are now looking for a brilliant and committed Climate Justice Researcher/Policy Officer to join our team and help ensure we are not only at the forefront of understanding and analysing the rapidly evolving climate law and policy landscape - but that we do so with a clear focus on principles and practices of environmental and climate justice and just transition, in order to:

* contribute to reducing inequalities and injustice related to and exacerbated by climate change  
* contribute to reducing adverse impacts on communities arising from the climate and energy transitions
* increase visibility and representation of environmental justice and just transition related issues of impacted communities 

## Roles and responsibilities

We’re looking for a Climate Justice and Just Transition Policy Officer with a solid background in climate justice policy/research work either within civil society organisations or research organisations/think tanks, with brilliant research and analytical skills. You will work within the policy and research teams, and in close collaboration with the data science and other teams:

* Using your domain knowledge, you’ll contribute to research to develop climate justice and just transition related taxonomies, that will feed into natural language processing and machine learning models for analysis of global climate-related legal and policy texts (no prior knowledge of data science or machine learning models is needed, though a keen interest and desire to learn is necessary!)
* Track emerging trends and proposals on climate justice and equity and provide analysis and advice to influence the product features that we introduce 
* Develop and maintain a network of partners and collaborators (academia and research institutions, IGOs, impacted communities, civil society and more), to: 

  * Make sure we are synced with latest thinking and developments in the field, including representation of impacted communities
  * Develop and deliver joint high-impact bespoke projects and programmes 
  * Help bring our work to them and their stakeholders. 
* Further our outreach by independently producing and/or contributing to written output like blog posts, articles, infographics
* Be a source of knowledge in your field of expertise contributing to the wider team

## You bring with you:

* At least 5 years experience in climate justice policy/research work, either within civil society organisations or research organisations/academia/think tanks
* Rigorous, detail-oriented, methodical research and analytical skills
* Creativity in your approach to problem solving
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change-related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, international negotiations and the UNFCCC process). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well-informed ‘Climatese’ speaker
* Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to communicate and translate knowledge to different audiences
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Excitement about the environment that a startup presents
* Values that are aligned with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values)

## We offer

* Salary £40-£50k pa, depending on experience
* A deep commitment to employee wellbeing, including policies such as 4 day workweek (same pay, Fridays off), generous leave, and a wellbeing allowance
* A vibrant, collaborative, and empathetic work culture that thrives on innovation and the impact of our work
* A hybrid work environment in London’s climate tech hub, offering views of the river in London’s County Hall Building. We have a 50% office presence each week
* Learn more about our values [here](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). We care about them deeply
