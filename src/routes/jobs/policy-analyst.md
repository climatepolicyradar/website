**Roles and responsibilities**

Working within the policy team and with the wider team, you’ll achieve impact by:

* Ensuring we maintain a well-curated and high-quality data set of public climate laws and policies by providing oversight of the data management process and identifying additional data to include. This will include a mix of data process management, finding new data and more manual data quality/entry tasks.
* Using your domain knowledge, you’ll contribute to research to develop climate policy related taxonomies, machine learning models and visualisations for analysis of global climate-related legal and policy texts (no prior knowledge of data science or machine learning models is needed, though a keen interest and desire to learn is necessary!)
* You’ll work with our head of policy to further our outreach by producing written output like blog posts, and working with external stakeholders in contributing to publications
* You’ll work with our head of policy and the wider team to deliver high-impact bespoke projects with a range of different partners across the climate and policy ecosystem
* You’ll influence the product features that we introduce through your insights about the world of law and policy
* You’ll provide first-line support for users of our data and tools
* You’ll be a source of knowledge contributing to the wider team, sharing developments in the world of climate change and policy

**You bring with you**

* A degree in climate change law/policy or equivalent work experience 
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change-related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, international negotiations and the UNFCCC process). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well-informed ‘Climatese’ speaker. 
* Detail-oriented, methodical, academically rigorous research skills 
* Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to communicate and translate knowledge to different audiences.
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Not afraid of spreadsheets.
* Excitement about the environment that a startup presents.
* Values that are aligned with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). 

**W﻿e offer**

* Salary £30k pa, depending on experience.
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing: our policies include unlimited leave, flexible work hours, an annual well-being allowance and short Fridays.
* Hybrid work setup: we meet as a team once or twice weekly. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s old County Hall building.
