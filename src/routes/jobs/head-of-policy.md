### About us

Climate Policy Radar is an AI startup on a mission to map and analyse the world’s climate law and policy data. Harnessing data science and AI and pioneering the application of natural language processing in this domain, our work unlocks previously inaccessible, unstructured data, and helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate rules, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We’re a Community Interest Company (not-for-profit), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice. With a [team of 12](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#team) (data science, software engineering, policy, comms and ops), we recently launched our [open access policy search tool](http://app.climatepolicyradar.org). We are continuing to develop our exciting product offering, and forging partnerships with research, policy and tech stakeholders to inform our ongoing work and bring it to our users. Climate Policy Radar is at an extremely exciting stage of development, and we are now looking for a brilliant and committed Head of Policy to join our team.

### **Roles and responsibilities**

As a trusted and senior member of the team, you’ll have the confidence and competence to take the lead and direct this role flexibly to identify new opportunities for policy impact and engagement, and ensure we keep up with the pace of the rapidly evolving climate policy landscape. 

Beyond that, these are your core missions

* Develop policy priorities for our products and programmes.
* Work within the team to embed your domain knowledge into the development of machine learning models and visualisations for analysis of global climate-related legal and policy texts.
* Work with external stakeholders and allies (policymakers, researchers, IGOs, MDBs, civil society) to design and carry out joint work to create and deliver knowledge and tools.

### You bring with you

* At least 6 years’ experience working in the climate law and/or policy space
* Broad horizons and familiarity with a wide range of climate change related concepts and issues (e.g. mitigation and adaptation policy approaches, basics of climate science, economics, climate-related technologies, and the international negotiations). Note we are not seeking in-depth expertise in all of those, but rather appreciate a rounded, well informed ‘Climatese’ speaker. 
* Remarkable interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to translate knowledge for different audiences.
* A voracious appetite for knowledge, and a knack for finding it and putting it to good use. 
* Critical thinking and willingness to challenge assumptions ‒ your own and others’.
* Excitement about the autonomy and changeability that a startup environment presents.
* Values that are aligned with [ours](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values). 

### We offer

* Salary £55-£60k, depending on experience.
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing: our policies include unlimited leave, flexible work hours, an annual well-being allowance and short Fridays.
* Hybrid work setup: we meet up as a team once or twice a week. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s County Hall.
