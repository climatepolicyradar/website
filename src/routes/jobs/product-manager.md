## Who we are

Climate Policy Radar (CPR) is a climate AI startup on a mission to map and analyse the world's fragmented climate policy data, making it easier to facilitate effective policy action.  We are using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to map and add semantic meaning to policy documents from around the world.  Our work helps governments, researchers, civil society and the private sector to understand and advance effective climate policies, enhance accountability, deploy climate finance, and promote data democratisation. 

We're a not-for-profit startup (registered Community Interest Company), having secured substantial grant funding in our first round in 2021, and about to fundraise for the next round. With a team of 9 and growing to 12, we have just launched our [first (Alpha) product](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/), working towards our General Access product in October/November. CPR is at an extremely exciting stage and we are looking for a brilliant and committed Product Manager to join our team.

## Role Overview

The role of the product manager is to understand our users, identify and prioritise product requirements, and ensure that these are clearly communicated to the rest of the team. As part of this, you will:

* Work with the users of our products in order to understand their needs, whilst consulting with our internal policy experts and with external partners (including academic and professional organisations). 
* Translate that research into user requirements to underpin product development. 
* Work with all teams to organise requirements into a product strategy and roadmap, which you will own and manage - balancing long-term product planning with managing detailed short-term requirements.
* Collect, analyse and respond to user feedback, including work iteratively with users to test new features’ effectiveness at addressing their challenges through rapid engagements
* Work alongside our engineering and data science teams to maintain and prioritise the product backlog.
* Work alongside our comms manager to effectively communicate product features and benefits
* Create a shared brain across teams to empower independent decision-making

## **Requirements**

The ideal candidate can combine two disparate fields: (policy) research and software product management.  You should have a strong background in at least one of these fields and be able to demonstrate how you can span the other area comfortably.  

* You have at least 3 years of experience managing software products, ideally targeted at professional audiences e.g. researchers, civil service, etc. 
* You demonstrated success defining and launching excellent products and an understanding of the development build lifecycle
* You understand and have a passion for research and data driven decision making, ideally in the legal, policy, or academic worlds (you will be supported by domain experts).
* You have a good understanding of product success metrics and when to use them.
* You are a proactive and clear communicator with people from diverse backgrounds - technical and non-technical
* You’ll understand best practices when it comes to product management and you’ll be able to advocate for the right approach to each project, ensuring the team understands how we get to each checkpoint
* You have good listening and negotiation skills with the ability to bring a team together to a shared vision
* You appreciate what it means to work in an early-stage startup - balancing trade-offs, rolling your sleeves up, pitching into shared efforts, and sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone.
* Your values align with [our values](https://climatepolicyradar.org/about#values) - we deeply care about them. 

### Would be great if you have…

* Worked on AI-driven products, and used to working closely with data scientists or machine learning engineers

## We offer…

* Salary £55k-£65k depending on experience
* Deep commitment to employee wellbeing: our policies include unlimited leave, flexible work hours, a wellbeing allowance and short Fridays.
* Hybrid work setup: we usually meet up as a team once/twice a week. We have a stunning workspace overlooking the river in London’s County Hall Building. 
* A chance to co-create and help us shape our journey: we are a young  startup building our team and vision, and we pride ourselves on our collaborative and mutually supportive culture, so your input and impact will be significant.

## Interview process

Interview with our tech lead and our people manager– 45-60 min. 

Interview with CEO and 2 other (technical and non-technical) team members - 1.5-2 hrs:

* Ahead of the interview, we will ask you to prepare a presentation (on which you should plan to spend approximately 2-3 hours). During the interview, you will present, and we will jointly discuss this at the interview
* Scenario-based questions
* Team/culture alignment questions
* Any questions you have for us.
